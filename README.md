## Overview

This project aims to provide clear and understandable implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms in C#. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts.

The implementations in this repository are based on similar implementations found in [Kata Machine Project repository written in TypeScript by The Primeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine). You can refer to that repository for additional explanations and insights into these concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/A-San96/KataMachineCsharp.git
    ```

2. Explore the codebase to understand the implementations of different data structures and algorithms.

3. To run or test specific algorithms, navigate to their respective directories and follow the instructions provided in their README files.

## Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

- `DataStructAndAlgorithm`: Contains implementations of various data structures and common algorithms..
- `DataStructAndAlgorithm.UnitTests`: Contains test cases for verifying the correctness of implementations.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find bugs, want to improve implementations, or add new algorithms/data structures, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request following our [contribution guidelines](link-to-contribution-guidelines).
